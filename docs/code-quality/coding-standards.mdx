At Kubix, we follow a specific set of guidelines to ensure our code is of the best possible quality and also ensure it's uniformity so developers can work with ease on new code.

## CSS/SCSS

Going forward, Kubix will be using the [BEM Methodology ~ naming convention](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/) in our development process.

The goal of implementing this is to make sure we have consistency across our dev team that will make it easier and more informative for each of us if/when we are needed to jump on exisiting projects.

### Breakdown of how it works

Take these CSS selector examples:

- `.menuitemvisible`
- `.menu-item-visible`
- `.menuItemVisible`

To understand the meaning of the first name, you need read through each word carefully.

In the last two examples, the name is clearly divided into its parts.
But none of these names helps us understand that `menu` is a **block**, `item` is an **element**, and `visible` is a **modifier**.

The rules for naming BEM entities were developed in order to make entity names unambiguous and easy to understand.

### Naming rules

Example: `.block-name__elem-name_mod-name_mod-val`

- Names are written in lowercase Latin letters.
- Words are separated by a hyphen (-).
- The block name defines the [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) for its elements and modifiers.
- The element name is separated from the block name by a double underscore (__).
- The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a single underscore (_).
- The modifier value is separated from the modifier name by a single underscore (_).
- For boolean modifiers, the value is not included in the name

### Naming style

The style we will be using at Kubix will be the **Two Dashes style**

Example: `.block-name__elem-name--mod-name--mod-val`

- Names are written in lowercase Latin letters.
- Words within the names of BEM entities are separated by a hyphen (-).
- The element name is separated from the block name by a double underscore (__).
- Boolean modifiers are separated from the name of the block or element by a double hyphen (--).
- The value of a modifier is separated from its name by a double hyphen (--).

#### Example

Let's take a slideshow as an example.
The slideshow has the parent container, a slide title and a slide button.

We would structure it as something like:

```html
<section class="slideshow slideshow--full-width">
  <div class="slide">
    <h1 class="slide__title slide__title--bold">Slideshow</h1>

    <a href="#" class="slide__button">Button</a>
  </div>

  <nav class="slideshow__navigation">
    <button class="slideshow__navigation-button slideshow__navigation-button--left">Preview slide</button>
    <button class="slideshow__navigation-button slideshow__navigation-button--right">Next slide</button>
  </nav>
</section>
```

In this example, `.slideshow` is a **block**, but it has a modifier class `.slideshow--full-width` to indicate that full-width isn't it's default state, but it's modified state.

Inside of that, we have `.slide` which is also a **block**, whilst each child of a block should generally become the **element**, it's not always required if that group could also be considered a **block** separately from the parent, so instead of `.slideshow__slide`, which is fully acceptable, we can narrow it down if needed to just `.slide`.

Because the slide's title and button are now children of a new **block**, the class names inherit their structure from their parent, in this case it's `.slide__title` and `.slide__button`. `.slide__title` also has it's modifier class to make it bold.
